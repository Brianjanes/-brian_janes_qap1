        <h3>Reliability</h3>
        <p>
          The 2018 Toyota Tacoma is widely recognized for its reliability.
          Toyota has a reputation for building long-lasting vehicles, and the
          Tacoma is no exception. It often ranks high in reliability surveys and
          receives positive feedback from owners for its dependability over the
          long term. The Tacoma's robust build quality and proven engineering

        <h3>Low Cost of Maintenance</h3>
        <p>
          Owners of the 2018 Tacoma can expect relatively low maintenance costs.
          Toyota's widespread availability of parts and extensive service
          network help keep repair and maintenance expenses reasonable.
          Additionally, the Tacoma's strong resale value means that owners can
          recover a significant portion of their investment when it comes time
          to sell or trade in the vehicle. Routine maintenance, such as oil
          changes and brake inspections, is straightforward and cost-effective,
          contributing to the overall affordability of owning a Tacoma.
